# A thing
library to deal with dictionaries 

## Why
Initialy was just a thing to help me win [wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). But then wordle stuff moved to its own [repo](https://github.com/Lurk/wordly_helper) and will serve as an example


## What it can do 
filter words in various ways, extract character weights and sort them

## API


## TODO
* docs
* tests
* benches
