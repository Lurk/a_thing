# A thing
library to deal with dictionaries 

## Why
Initialy was just a thing to help me win [wordly game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). But then wordly stuff moved to its own [repo](https://github.com/Lurk/wordly_helper) and will serve as an example


## What it can do 
filter words in various ways, extract character weights and sort them

## API

### Dict::from_file(path)
Creates a dictionary from a file which contains a list of words separated by new line

### Dict::from_vec(vec)
Creates a dictionary from a Vec<String>
